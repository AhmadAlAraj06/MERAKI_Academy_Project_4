        <h2>How blood is used</h2>
        <p>
          Blood or the components of blood are used to treat patients with
          medical conditions such as anemia, cancer blood disorders, and those
          having surgery.
        </p>
        <h3>Blood components</h3>
        <p>
          Blood is made up of a number of components, including{" "}
          <span style={{ fontWeight: "bolder" }}>red blood cells</span>,{" "}
          <span style={{ fontWeight: "bolder" }}>platelets</span> and{" "}
          <span style={{ fontWeight: "bolder" }}>plasma</span>. Each of these
          can be used to treat many different conditions. Blood is usually
          separated into its individual components or parts, so a patient can be
          given the particular component they need. This makes the most of every
          blood donation, as the components in one unit of blood (or one
          donation) can be used to treat different patients.
        </p>
        <h3>Blood transfusions</h3>
        <p>
          Donated blood or components are given to a patient in a blood
          transfusion. Blood transfusions are given via an intravenous line into
          a blood vessel. Around two thirds of the blood donated is used to
          treat medical conditions including anaemia, cancer and blood disorders
          Nearly a third is used in surgery and emergencies including childbirth
          Usage varies between hospitals depending on their particular
          specialties. We work closely with hospitals to make sure valuable
          blood donations are used appropriately. The demand for blood from
          hospitals has fallen due to increased efficiency, but new donors are
          always needed to make sure there is enough blood to treat those who
          need it.
        </p>
        <h3>Blood transfusions for people who are dying</h3>
        <p>
          Blood can be vital for people with medical conditions or who are
          having surgery. But blood transfusions can also improve the quality of
          life for people whose illness has no cure. Karen Clarke, a community
          nurse who gives transfusions to terminally ill people in their own
          homes, says: 'These vital transfusions give patients a better quality
          of life and the energy and ability to enjoy this precious, final time
          with their families'.
        </p>
        <h3>Blood not used for transfusion</h3>
        <p>
          Sometimes, blood may not be suitable for transfusion. This blood can
          still benefit patients in areas like the development of treatments and
          therapies. Blood can be very useful for research and training, and to
          help develop tests. We do not sell blood, or its components, for
          non-clinical use.
