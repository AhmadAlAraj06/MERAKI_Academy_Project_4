        <h2>What happens on the day</h2>
        From the moment you arrive at your donation session, we will guide you
        through the process, explain what we are doing and answer any questions
        you may have about becoming a blood donor. <br />
        <h2>Welcome and preparation</h2>
        Before donating blood, please eat regular meals, drink plenty of fluid
        (non-alcoholic) and avoid vigorous exercise or exertion. Remember to
        bring your completed donor health check form with you, if you received
        one from us in the post. If you ever need to cancel a donation
        appointment we ask that you give us 3 days’ notice so that we can offer
        your appointment to another donor. When you attend your donation session
        please read our welcome booklet - this explains the importance of blood
        safety. It's important to read this every time you attend, because
        advice does change. We must give you sufficient information so that you
        can make an informed choice, on the benefits and risks of donating blood
        and samples for testing. We will provide 500ml of fluid just before you
        donate. By drinking this over about 5 minutes, it will help with your
        wellbeing during and after donation. <br />
        <h2>Health screening</h2>
        You will be called for private health screening, where a donor carer
        will confirm your identity. It’s critical that we guarantee an accurate
        link between you, your Donor Health Check and your donation. We must
        ensure that it's safe for you to donate and your donation is safe for a
        patient to receive. We’ll ask some confidential questions based on your
        completed Donor Health Check. There is a period of time from contact
        with any infection to detecting markers in the laboratory. We trust your
        honesty when answering these personal questions. This will ensure your
        blood is safe to transfuse to patients. You may be referred to a
        registered nurse for medical queries. An explanation will always be
        provided if you are not able to donate. You will be advised when you can
        donate, and we’ll encourage you to make an appointment before you leave.
        For your wellbeing, we must ensure you have enough haemoglobin (iron) in
        your blood before donating. Your haemoglobin (Hb) test involves us
        taking a small blood sample from your finger to test your Hb levels. If
        your test is borderline, we will offer you a confirmatory test. This
        requires a sample of blood from your arm, to be tested in a machine at
        the session. We will advise you of the result. Following health
        screening, you will be asked to sit in a different waiting area. From
        here you’ll be called and invited to a donation chair. <br />
        <h2>Your donation</h2>
        When you are comfortable on the chair, you will be asked your name,
        address and date of birth again. Blood bags and sample tubes are
        labelled with unique donor identification numbers. All collection
        equipment is single use and sterile; only one blood bag is filled with
        your donation. A blood pressure cuff will be placed on your arm to
        maintain a small amount of pressure during your donation. The cuff is
        not used to measure blood pressure. Your arm will be thoroughly examined
        to find a suitable vein before being cleaned with an antiseptic sponge.
        This kills normal flora on the skin (bacteria that normally exist on
        skin). You will see staff cleaning their hands frequently, using hand
        wipes or gels. Donors are advised to do applied muscle tension exercises
        during donation. This is to maintain blood pressure and promote
        wellbeing during and after donation. Following needle insertion you
        should be comfortable during your donation. If you experience any
        discomfort or pain please alert a member of staff. An agitator scale
        constantly weighs and measures your donation. It will stop automatically
        when your donation is complete. Donor carers will be available to you
        throughout your donation. You may hear beeping noises from the agitator,
        these inform us of the progress of your donation. A full donation is
        470ml and will usually take between 5 and 10 minutes. If you require
        assistance or have any concerns, please make us aware by raising your
        non-donation arm. After donation, the needle will be removed and a
        sterile dressing applied to your arm. We advise that you leave the
        pressure roll on for 30 minutes and the plaster dressing on for 6 hours.
        Please avoid using this arm to push on or to carry anything heavy. We
        will give you a card at the end of your donation with important care
        advice. Donors are also asked to apply additional pressure to the
        venepuncture site while waiting for their drink at the refreshment area.{" "}
        <br />
        <h2>After donation refreshment</h2>A selection of drinks and snacks are
        available at the refreshment table. We encourage donors to relax here
        for at least 15 minutes and to have at least 2 drinks following
        donation. If you feel unwell, please remain seated and alert a member of
        staff immediately. Where possible, we encourage you to book an
        appointment for your next donation. <br />
        <h2>At home</h2>
        Please do not have a hot bath on the day of your donation.
